The rules of 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel are generalized from the rules of ordinary chess.
The 5D in the name refers to the typical two spatial dimensions,a third unused spatial dimension, a fourth dimension representing time, and a fifth dimension representing parallel timelines.
When pieces travel to the past, paradoxes are avoided by using a branching timeline system.

Subjects:
1) What is checkmate?
2) How are a piece's available moves determined?
3) What happens when a piece travels to the past?
4) Who's turn is it, and on which timelines must they move?

1) What is checkmate?
    If a player has no way to end their turn (no way to move The Present without leaving themselves in check), then they are checkmated.
	For a game with a single timeline, this means all of their moves leave them in check (equivalent to ordinary chess).
	For a game with multiple timelines, it means every combination of moves leaves them in check and every time travel move leaves them in check.
	A move that attacks a king's past is a valid check (it is not a special case, consider that applying the move would create a timeline with a captured king on it).

2) How are a piece's available moves determined?
    The existing rules that determine a piece's available moves are not specific to two dimensions.
	The movement rules are interpreted using additional coordinates to describe a piece's position.
	At the start of the game, white's queenside rook is on square A1. Technically, that rook is on turn 1, timeline 0, file A, rank 1.
	Just like in ordinary chess, a rook moves in a line with one dimension.
	A rook moving forward across the board is moving in one dimension becuase it is changing its row, but keeping its column, turn, and timeline constant.
	A rook moving into the past would change its turn, but keep its row, column, and timeline constant.

2a) Why are two boards equal to one turn?
    In ordinary chess, each numbered turn of the game is one move from white and one from black.
	For example, "1. e4 e5 2. f4 ..." is notation for the King's Gambit opening.
	Therefore, one turn is the distance between your move and your previous move (with your opponent's reply in between).

2b) Piece movement descriptions:
	A rook moves any distance in one dimension.

	A bishop moves any distance in two dimensions at once. A direction defined by two dimensions is called a diagonal. In ordinary chess, bishops move along row/column diagonals.

	A knight moves two squares in one dimension, then one square in a different dimension.

	A queen moves any distance in any number of dimensions at once. This is more than just rook+bishop movement, becuase it includes triagonals and quadragonals.

	A king can move one square in any number of dimensions at once.

	A pawn moves one or two squares at a time in the "forward" direction. In ordinary chess, "forward" means towards your opponent's back row.
		Here, it also means "forward" towards your opponent's back timeline.
		A pawn can attack forward on row/column diagonals and forward on turn/timeline diagonals.


3) What happens when a piece travels to the past?
    If a player moves a piece to a board where a move has already occured (part of a timeline's history), a new branch is created becuase history cannot be altered.
	The latest move on the new timeline is the time travelling piece's arrival. The latest move on the original timeline is the time travelling piece's departure.
	If a piece is moved to a board where a move has not yet been played (no established history), no branch occurs.

4) Who's turn is it, and on which timelines must they move?
    A player makes moves as long as it is their turn in The Present.
	The Present is wherever the earliest board without a move is on any active timeline.
	To complete a turn, a player may need to make multiple moves to advance all the active timelines to the next turn.
	If a player can create a new timeline, they can rewind The Present as a result of that single move, even if they had multiple boards in the present.
	If a player branches one or more times before their opponent branches, the extra branches will be inactive, and won't affect The Present until their opponent makes more branches.
